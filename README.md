# Soundpages

Soundpages is a web application that allows users to create soundboards inspired by the design aesthetics of MySpace and websites from the late 90s. Users can create soundboards and upload sounds into them, which can then be accessed and played by other users.

## Features

- **Create Soundboards**: Users can create their own unique soundboards with a nostalgic design.

- **Upload Sounds**: Users can upload their own audio files to add to their soundboards. This allows for a diverse range of sounds to be shared and showcased.

- **View Soundboards**: Soundboards created by users can be viewed by other users. This allows for sharing and discovering different soundboards.

- **User Interactions**: Users can interact with soundboards created by others and play the uploaded sounds.

- **Keybind Functionality**: Users can assign keybinds to specific sounds on their soundboards. This enables quick and easy triggering of sounds by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard.

- **Captioned Sounds**: Each sound can be given a title, and when that sound is played, the title is displayed at the bottom of each soundboard. This provides context and information about the played sound.
